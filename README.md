# KanhaSays

KanhaSays is a web application that provides users with relevant verses from the Bhagavad Gita based on their queries. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data and a neural network to learn how to provide relevant verses based on the user's intent.

## Functionalities

KanhaSays has the following functionalities:

### Verse Retrieval

We have created a JSON file that contains all of the verses from the Bhagavad Gita. The model is trained using this data to learn how to provide relevant verses based on the user's query. When a user enters their query, the model first converts it into tokens and intents. It then searches the JSON file for the relevant verse based on the user's intent and provides it to the user.

### Translation and Audio

We have included a feature that allows users to translate the verse into their preferred language and listen to it. This feature is useful for users who may not understand the original Sanskrit text of the Bhagavad Gita.

### Dark and Light Themes

We have also added a feature that allows users to switch between dark and light themes based on their preference. This feature provides users with a comfortable reading experience.
